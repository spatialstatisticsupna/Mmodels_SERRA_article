# Bayesian inference in multivariate spatio-temporal areal models using INLA: analysis of gender-based violence in small areas
This repository contains the R code to fit the models described in the paper entitled _"Bayesian inference in multivariate spatio-temporal areal models using INLA: analysis of gender-based violence in small areas"_ [(Vicente et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00477-020-01808-x). If we are using a version of R > 4.0.0 we advise to use the TESTING version of INLA.
